            I am a student web developer from the great city of Cleveland Ohio.
            It is very cold and icy here which makes it the perfect place to
            study. I go to the best bootcamp on the planet at Case Western
            Reserve University. The Monday Wednesday class is very small so we
            all get great individualized attention from the instructor, Max, and
            the TAs, Mike and Steve. My classmates, Pam, Crystal, Vincent, and
            Dominque all help each other out to get this. Football season is
            over and the Cavaliers are awful right now without Lebron. Better
            Call Saul doesn't come back for a long time. That makes the only
            thing worth watching on TV to be Game of Thrones which doesn't come
            back until April. It is great that there is nothing to watch which
            forces me to study.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            My cat, Pinto, is the best creature on earth that helps me study.
            She is very quiet which makes it easy to focus. She snuggles right
            next to me and gives me moral support when coding goes rough. She is
            my best friend and there is no way I could do this without her.
            Everyone else is encouraging but they are too busy with important
            activities to be there for me like my cat.
          </p>

          <p class="bio">
            I hope to learn as much as I can from this course, my instructors
            and my peers. There is so much new and exiting information to learn!
